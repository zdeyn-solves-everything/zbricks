# ZBricks Documentation

- All documentation source files are now in `/docs/src/`.
- Generated documentation output will go in `/docs/build/` (or `/site/` for MkDocs).
- Legacy developer workflow notes are in `/docs/legacy/`.

To build or serve the docs, use your chosen tool (Sphinx, MkDocs, etc.) and point it at `/docs/src/` as the source directory.
